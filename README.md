# HTML CSS Login Form Template With Source Code
A login and registration template is a pre-designed webpage or user interface (UI) that provides a layout and design for a website's login and registration pages. These templates typically include forms for users to enter their login credentials (such as a username and password) or to create a new account by entering their personal information and creating a new username and password.

Some login and registration templates may also include additional features such as social media login options (e.g. logging in with a Facebook or Google account), password recovery options, or security features like CAPTCHAs to prevent automated bots from creating fake accounts.

The purpose of a login and registration template is to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience for website visitors who need to create an account or log in to an existing account. These templates can save time and resources for website developers by providing a pre-designed and tested interface that can be easily customized and integrated into a website.
